# Space Travel
## The site is written using the React JavaScript library, functional components, React Routes and maybe something else.
### Space travel is no longer the future! No matter how attractive the slogan of this site is, it will not make the project easier. In the name of beauty, I had to sacrifice lightness and add a video with space to the background. If you have a 3G connection, then start opening the site before going to bed, and enjoy it in the morning.
